		<div>After six years of construction, the international terminal officially opens on Oct. 31. The terminal doubles the size of the airport, completing a $2.6-billion expansion, which includes the new runway. Here’s a closeup look at the facility.</div>

		<div>An ethanol-water mix circulates through 581 geothermal wells beneath the terminal and in-floor tubing, cooling the building in the summer and providing heat in the winter. It’s estimated the geothermal field will cut energy consumption by half compared to the existing terminal. In addition, water collected on the roof is stored in tanks and used to flush toilets and urinals throughout the building.</div>
		<div>Boarding bridges are able to pivot, telescope, and adjust vertically. Two bridges can even be used on the same aircraft to speed up loading and unloading. The new terminal features 24 gates for international and U.S. destinations.</div>
		<div>Passenger loading</div>
		<div>Passengers enter their travel details at one of 25 kiosks. The kiosk scans the passport, photographs the traveller and prints a receipt, which is shown to a border officer for final verification. The technology is able to communicate in 36 languages, speeding up processing times by as much as 89 per cent.</div>
		<div>Security scanning</div>
		<div>Instead of filling out a declaration card, passengers enter their travel details at one of 25 Automated Passport Control kiosks. The kiosk scans the passport, photographs the traveller and prints a receipt, which is shown to a border officer for final verification. Vancouver International Airport, which developed the technology, claims the kiosks speed up processing times by as much as 89 per cent. The kiosks are able to communicate in 36 languages.</div>
